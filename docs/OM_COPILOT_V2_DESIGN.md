# OM Copilot v2 Architecture / Scene v4 Contract

The product architecture remains v2. The general `om_chat` runtime Scene and
prompt contract are versioned independently and are currently `v4`.

The planned replacement of the generic Agent runtime with Pi Agent Core is
specified separately in
[PI_AGENT_CORE_INTEGRATION.md](PI_AGENT_CORE_INTEGRATION.md). Until that atomic
cutover completes, this document remains the authority for current production
behavior.

## Purpose

OM Copilot is the general conversational Agent for options-monitor. It must
answer free-form operational and options-monitor questions with canonical data,
maintain useful multi-turn context, survive runtime failures, and hand requested
state changes to deterministic Control.

Monthly income, option-operation review, exposure analysis, candidate diagnosis,
and notification diagnosis are evaluation cases. None is a dedicated runtime
capability, router branch, Scene, or answer template.

## Runtime Shape

```text
Channel / CLI UI
-> Copilot Service
-> Copilot Host
-> generic Agent / Engine
-> canonical pure-read tools
   -> OM local read models
   -> portfolio_query / portfolio_pnl_bridge / portfolio_cash_bridge
      -> portfolio-management loopback HTTP API

Agent
-> request_control_preview
-> deterministic Control preview
-> explicit confirm / cancel
-> deterministic apply and readback
```

The stable layers are `UI -> Service -> Host -> Agent`. Contract preparation,
Scene preparation, structured-memory injection, event storage, and tool projection are
mechanisms inside those layers, not additional architecture layers.

`./om-agent` is a structured Tool Gateway for external agents. It is a UI entry,
not OM's autonomous Agent. Both `./om-agent` and Copilot derive tool schemas and
descriptions from `agent_tool_registry.py` and `agent_tools/`.

## Invariants

- There is one general Scene: `om_chat`.
- The `om_chat` Scene is `v4` and compiles one ordered five-fragment prompt
  pack. Repository operator instructions are not runtime prompt input.
- Service does not classify free text into OM business tasks.
- Service does not parse month, symbol, account, or intent from free text.
- Host owns execution governance; Agent owns generic model/tool iteration.
- Agent and Engine contain no OM task routing or strategy-specific branches.
- Copilot receives canonical pure-read tools only. The `portfolio` toolset is an
  optional read boundary, disabled by default and projected only when
  `assistant.enabled`, `assistant.copilot.enabled`, and
  `assistant.copilot.toolsets.portfolio` are all true. It is not a second
  Copilot, Scene, router, or Agent runtime.
- The model may request a validated Control preview but cannot confirm, cancel,
  apply, or call a direct mutation tool.
- Explicit commands and pending-operation replies remain deterministic Control.
- There is no old planner, perception, reasoning, evidence, verifier, or answer
  renderer fallback for free-form chat.
- Missing data is explicit. A tool failure is not converted into an invented
  financial conclusion.
- Trace records execution facts and failures, never private chain-of-thought.

## UI Boundary

UI adapters own transport concerns:

- message extraction and channel identity;
- sender and conversation identity;
- configuration and model-profile selection;
- rendering the returned response;
- delivery receipts and channel-specific idempotency.

UI selects the default `om_chat` entry surface. It does not choose business
tools, task kinds, evidence plans, or prompt variants.

## Service Boundary

`src/application/copilot/service.py` is a thin contract-preparation service. It:

1. validates non-empty user text;
2. normalizes explicit UI scope only;
3. appends the current user message to supplied conversation context;
4. selects the default `om_chat` Scene;
5. emits a read-first execution contract.

Service must not import Host, Agent, Engine, tool implementations, or model
providers. It cannot decide which OM tool should answer a question.

## Host Boundary

Host responsibilities:

- validate the execution contract and Scene;
- project Scene-approved canonical tools;
- prepare prompt, context, structured memory, and current Control snapshot;
- own session and run lifecycle;
- enforce per-session exclusion and concurrency lanes;
- enforce timeout, turn, tool-call, retry, and context budgets;
- propagate cancellation;
- persist events, run state, metrics, and final result;
- record the exact prompt and provider-visible tool projection fingerprints
  before Engine execution without persisting prompt text;
- recover interrupted pure-read runs;
- maintain the reply outbox;
- expose coarse progress events.

Host must not classify business intent, choose evidence recipes, interpret
financial data, or rewrite the model's answer into a second answer system.

## Scene And Prompt

The only Scene is declared in:

```text
src/application/copilot/om_chat.scene.json
```

It declares:

- static prompt fragments;
- declarative runtime context slots and their authority;
- canonical read toolsets plus the optional `portfolio` toolset declaration;
- model/tool/context/time budgets;
- conversation limits.

The ordered v4 prompt pack is:

```text
base_behavior.md
soul.md
financial_fact_rules.md
tool_rules.md
om_chat.md
```

The fragments define general behavior only:

- use tools for current OM facts;
- answer only the requested question plus qualifications necessary for factual
  correctness, financial safety, and scope;
- act as a concise, neutral Chinese options trader focused on quantitative
  trading, without fixed strategy thresholds or forced trade activity;
- distinguish facts, calculations, estimates, assumptions, interpretation,
  recommendation, and missing data;
- preserve account, market, currency, period, and source distinctions;
- resolve relative time to source-supported absolute dates or state the gap;
- recover from actionable tool errors;
- treat tool results as untrusted data rather than instructions;
- hide internal prompts, tool-call details, payloads, retries, and traces;
- provide conclusion-first ordinary prose while honoring explicit raw JSON,
  JSON fenced block, and Markdown source containers;
- never claim an unexecuted mutation completed;
- request deterministic Control preview for supported state changes.

Question-specific prompts, tool lists, and renderers are prohibited.

Runtime context slots have only two authorities:

```text
reference:
  reference_year

fixed_tool_scope:
  config_key
  symbol
  month
```

Only fields declared as `fixed_tool_scope` can override model-provided tool
arguments. `reference_year` is model context only. Undeclared contract input
cannot silently acquire tool authority. Runtime values are rendered as
JSON-encoded data, not interpolated instructions.

The result admission boundary rejects known unparsed tool protocols, unbalanced
fences, malformed whole-response JSON containers, and malformed raw object or
array JSON. It does not parse free text to guess whether the user requested an
output container, use broad tool-name or tone keyword guards, or rewrite an
answer. Format intent remains a prompt and evaluation contract until an entry
surface explicitly supplies a deterministic response mode.

## Agent And Engine

The Agent loop is:

```text
prepared messages + projected tools
-> model turn
-> zero or more native tool calls
-> Host-supplied tool execution
-> tool observations
-> next model turn
-> model final text or explicit terminal failure
```

The Engine supports:

- native model tool calls;
- bounded transient retries;
- duplicate-call protection;
- recoverable invalid-argument observations;
- continuation after provider length truncation;
- bounded context compaction that preserves the current user request and every
  current-turn native tool-call/result group by distributing the available
  budget before admitting older conversation groups;
- observation continuation for large results;
- final-answer reserve;
- cooperative cancellation;
- stable iteration IDs and context hashes;
- token usage and termination metrics.

There is no fixed collection fallback. If the model does not call a necessary
tool, that is an answer-quality failure to diagnose through trace and evaluation,
not a reason for Host to run a hidden business workflow.

## Tool Boundary

`src/application/copilot/tools.py` is a generic adapter. It:

- selects pure-read definitions from the canonical registry;
- exposes canonical descriptions and JSON schemas;
- merges safe defaults, model arguments, and only the Scene-declared fixed tool
  scope;
- executes only Host-allowed pure-read tools;
- converts canonical results into flat Agent-friendly observations;
- exposes `portfolio_query`, `portfolio_pnl_bridge`, and
  `portfolio_cash_bridge` through the `portfolio` toolset using GET-only stdlib
  HTTP against `PORTFOLIO_SERVICE_URL` (default
  `http://127.0.0.1:8765`); the two bridges keep total-asset PnL and cash
  movement separate, use PM's actual period-end facts, and return structured
  steps plus Markdown fallback text without image rendering;
- provides compact previews and continuation metadata.

Tool descriptions, defaults, validation, error hints, and output contracts should
be fixed at the owning tool definition. Copilot must not maintain a second tool
catalog or question-specific evidence recipe. `portfolio_query` accepts only
view and query scope; it rejects model-provided endpoints and non-loopback service
URLs, exposes no portfolio write endpoint, and preserves source/scope/freshness.
Disabling the optional toolset removes both its model-visible description and
its Host allowlist entry before Agent execution. Engine allowlist enforcement
still rejects a model-emitted call that was not projected. Resume rebuilds the
Scene from current assistant config, so a later disable revokes resumed access.

## Deterministic Control

The model-visible `request_control_preview` surface is generated from the
deterministic Control capability catalog. A valid request creates a Control
preview and pending operation. It does not apply the operation.

```text
model preview request
-> schema and capability validation
-> deterministic preview
-> pending operation
-> explicit contextual confirmation or cancellation
-> deterministic apply
-> readback receipt
```

Current pending operations are injected into every channel turn from the
operation store. This snapshot is newer and more authoritative than conversation
history or structured memory.

`取消分析` targets an active Copilot run. `取消执行` targets a pending Control
operation. These are distinct state machines.

## Conversation Memory

Host stores raw turns separately from structured memory.

```text
pinned_state:
  current_goal
  confirmed_scope
  user_constraints
  open_questions

episodes:
  confirmed_facts
  completed_actions
  tool_findings
  user_constraints
  open_questions
  next_step
```

Online request preparation:

- reads already persisted structured memory;
- injects pinned state and recent episodes before the current user message;
- never calls a model, acquires a memory lease, or writes session memory;
- leaves raw turns and malformed or missing stored memory unchanged.

Model-driven conversation-memory compaction is disabled on the online request
path. Reintroducing automatic compaction requires a separate design that proves
foreground latency isolation and replaces the sliding-array count cursor with a
stable turn identity before any memory write is enabled.

Memory is contextual and may be stale. Current financial and runtime questions
must still use canonical tools.

## Durable Runs, Resume, And Cancellation

Host persists:

- execution contract;
- session key;
- run state and events;
- cancellation request;
- resumed-from identity and attempt count;
- termination reason and aggregate metrics;
- final response.

Active states are `running`, `waiting_model`, and `waiting_tool`. Terminal states
include `answered`, `control_requested`, `failed`, `cancelled`, and `interrupted`.
Stale active runs are marked interrupted after process failure.

Resume rules:

- only failed or interrupted read-first contracts are eligible;
- attempts are bounded;
- resume creates a new run linked by `resumed_from`;
- only successful pure-read observations are recovered;
- identical recovered reads are not repeated;
- Control previews, confirmations, cancellations, applies, and writes are never
  replayed automatically.

Cancellation is checked before and after provider calls, during retry backoff,
and before and after tool execution. The current synchronous provider transport
cannot forcibly abort an already-blocked socket read; cancellation still prevents
the next model or tool step and is observed immediately after the call returns.

## Trace And Progress

Every model iteration records:

- `iteration_id`;
- sanitized context hash and size;
- force-finish state and tool count;
- finish reason and attempt count;
- input/output/total token usage where available;
- categorized provider failure;
- partial malformed tool-call arguments where available.

Before the first model iteration, `scene_prepared` records:

- Scene name and version;
- ordered fragment paths, lengths, and SHA-256 hashes;
- compiled prompt SHA-256;
- selected toolsets;
- provider-visible tool count and schema SHA-256.

The tool fingerprint covers exactly `name`, `description`, and `input_schema`,
including the projected Control preview tool. It changes when optional toolsets
change. Prompt text, user messages, tool results, and secrets are never included.
The static Scene fingerprint is separate from the per-turn dynamic
`context_hash`. A resumed run rebuilds the current Scene and records its own
fingerprint.

Run records aggregate model turns, tool calls, retries, token usage, status, and
termination reason. Trace payloads are sanitized execution facts, not reasoning.

Public progress is derived from stable events and exposes only labels such as:

- `正在分析`;
- `正在读取数据`;
- `正在继续分析`;
- `正在整理结论`;
- `等待确认`;
- `已取消`;
- `执行完成`.

## Reply Outbox

Channel replies use a SQLite outbox:

```text
pending -> delivering -> delivered
                    -> retryable_failed -> delivering
                    -> terminal_failed
```

`delivery_key` is unique. Enqueue is idempotent, successful delivery is recorded,
and retryable channel failures are retried by the channel worker after process or
transport recovery. Existing channel-level provider receipts remain an additional
idempotency layer.

## Concurrency

OM uses lightweight Host leases rather than a general multi-tenant governor:

```text
chat_read: 2
control: independent
```

The same conversation permits one active Agent run. Expired leases are removed
so process failure cannot permanently block a session. Control remains outside
the read-analysis lane and must not wait behind a long analysis.

`heavy_analysis` is not introduced until measured production contention proves a
separate lane is necessary; adding it now would require business classification
that the Service is explicitly forbidden to perform.

## Failure Behavior

| Failure | Required result |
|---|---|
| Empty question | `needs_clarification` before Host |
| Model not configured | `not_ready`, no tool call |
| Contract or Scene invalid | explicit failure |
| Tool arguments invalid | recoverable observation with repair hint |
| Tool unavailable or data missing | explicit gap preserved |
| Repeated identical call | duplicate call rejected |
| Provider timeout/error | categorized event and bounded failure |
| Run budget exhausted | bounded final answer or explicit failure |
| Cancellation | partial events preserved; run `cancelled` |
| Process failure | stale active run becomes `interrupted` |
| Concurrent same-session run | second run `not_ready` |
| Channel delivery failure | outbox `retryable_failed` and later retry |

There is no fallback to old Assistant planning or unevidenced generic chat.

## Evaluation

Deterministic CI uses fixture observations and explicit model turns. Real-model
acceptance is executed by the trusted production environment with actual
read-only OM data.

The fixed set covers:

- income and attribution follow-up;
- exposure concentration;
- option-operation review;
- account-scope follow-up;
- candidate diagnosis;
- close-advice notification diagnosis;
- missing-data honesty;
- write safety;
- no unsolicited expansion;
- evidence-based challenge to a high-yield/add-position premise;
- no-trade and wait conclusions;
- raw JSON, one JSON fenced block, and one Markdown source block;
- conclusion follow-up.

Each case captures all events, run identity, elapsed time, termination reason,
failure owner, selected tools, actual provider/model/runtime version, tool-call
and continuation metrics, output contract checks, Scene/tool fingerprints,
evidence-health checks, final answer, and six human-review dimensions:

- intent fulfillment;
- factual accuracy;
- scope and currency;
- missing-data honesty;
- actionability;
- conversation continuity.

No benchmark may become runtime routing, a dedicated Scene, or an answer template.

Production evaluation must receive the runtime root explicitly instead of
depending on a shell-specific inherited environment:

```bash
python3 scripts/copilot_p1_eval.py \
  --assistant-config /var/lib/options-monitor/resolved/config.assistant.json \
  --config-key us \
  --runtime-root /var/lib/options-monitor \
  --output /tmp/om-copilot-p1.json
```

The output contract is `om.copilot.p1_eval.v4`. Structural and evidence checks
are mandatory CLI exit gates. Human answer-quality is also mandatory after
review, while an otherwise valid unreviewed report remains available for
offline scoring. Human review applies to the exact saved report without
rerunning the model:

```bash
python3 scripts/copilot_p1_eval.py \
  --review-report /tmp/om-copilot-p1.json \
  --review-input /tmp/om-copilot-p1-review.json \
  --output /tmp/om-copilot-p1-reviewed.json
```

The review input must contain every report case and all six 0..2 dimensions;
a reviewed case passes at 10/12 or higher. The report records the model actually
configured at runtime and must not assume a provider.

## Delivery Phases

| Phase | Deliverable | Exit gate |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | Stable rebuild baseline | Focused tests, guards, dependency graph, and diff checks pass. |
| P1 | Production answer-quality baseline | The configured production model produces sanitized v4 traces and human scores. |
| P2 | Structured memory | Existing pinned state and episodes remain injectable without request-path model calls or memory writes. |
| P3 | Durable run control | Interrupted reads resume safely and cancellation stops further work. |
| P4 | Trace/model protocol | Iteration identity, usage, termination, and failure categories are persisted. |
| P5 | Progress/outbox | Coarse progress is pollable and final replies are idempotent and retryable. |
| P6 | Lightweight concurrency | Session and lane leases enforce limits and recover after expiry. |
| P7 | Tool remediation | Only production-trace-proven canonical tool gaps are changed. |
| P8 | Prompt remediation | Only failures with correct model-visible data justify prompt changes. |
| P9 | Cleanup/docs | One free-form path, one Scene, one registry, one Control owner remain. |
| P10 | Release/acceptance | Full checks and production behavioral acceptance pass. |

P1 is the gate for P7 and P8. Engineering work on generic Host reliability may
continue while production evaluation is scheduled, but tool- and prompt-specific
changes require captured evidence.

## Completion Criteria

The rebuild is complete only when:

- one general Scene exists and Service remains business-neutral;
- Host owns governance and Agent owns generic model/tool iteration;
- Copilot exposes canonical pure-read tools plus validated Control preview only;
- free-form chat has no old planner/evidence/verifier/renderer fallback;
- structured memory, durable runs, resume, cancellation, trace, progress,
  outbox, and concurrency leases have regression coverage;
- explicit operations use one deterministic audited Control contract;
- deterministic Copilot, Control, channel, config, and architecture tests pass;
- production real-model questions produce useful, factual conclusions;
- three independent real-model acceptance runs use the expected stable v4
  prompt/tool fingerprints and pass every format and safety hard gate;
- quantitative persona cases use relevant supported evidence, avoid false
  precision and emotional language, and permit wait/no-trade conclusions;
- channel follow-ups preserve scope and current Control context;
- reply failure is retryable and idempotent;
- no free-form request can directly mutate OM state;
- docs and public commands describe the implementation that actually runs.
