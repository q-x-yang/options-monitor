# Agent Handbook - options-monitor

> This is the task-driven manual for local agents working in `options-monitor`.
> Keep `AGENTS.md` short enough for prompt prefix use; put detailed execution guidance here.

## 1. Operating Model

`options-monitor` is an operations-sensitive local monitoring system for options strategies.
Local agents should treat it as production tooling:

- Inspect before changing.
- Prefer read-only tools before runtime commands.
- Keep production config, notification sends, Feishu writes, and broker-facing state behind explicit user intent.
- Use existing public facades before importing internals or calling scripts.
- Preserve unrelated local edits.

Primary entry points:

| Need | Entry |
|---|---|
| Structured tool call / JSON response | `./om-agent` Tool Gateway |
| Local or remote message handling | `./om assistant handle` Inbound Assistant |
| Human/operator command | `./om` |
| Runtime tick | `./om run tick ...` |
| Guarded production tick wrapper | `./om run tick-cron ...` |
| MacBook Codex online-evidence handoff | `./om research collect ...` |

Entrypoint rule:

- Use `./om-agent` for structured local JSON tool calls, manifest checks, and
  read-first diagnostics.
- Use `./om assistant handle` for local or remote messages. This is the
  Inbound Assistant surface.
- Explicit commands and pending-operation replies use deterministic Control.
  Every other message enters the single read-only `om_chat` Copilot Scene when
  `assistant.copilot.enabled` is true. There is no business router, per-Scene
  channel allowlist, planner fallback, or write-capable model path.

For the canonical entry and layer boundaries, see
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) and [INBOUND_CONTROL.md](INBOUND_CONTROL.md).
For capability boundaries, risk classes, Inbound Assistant exposure, and
verification maps, see [OM_AGENT_CAPABILITY_MAP.md](OM_AGENT_CAPABILITY_MAP.md).

## 2. First Five Minutes

When entering an unfamiliar task, gather just enough context:

```bash
git status --short
rg -n "<user keyword>" README.md docs AGENTS.md src domain tests
./om-agent spec
```

For live quality or runtime questions, start with existing state:

```bash
./om-agent run --tool runtime_status --input-json '{"config_key":"us"}'
./om-agent run --tool healthcheck --input-json '{"config_key":"us"}'
./om-agent run --tool scheduler_status --input-json '{"config_key":"us","account":"lx"}'
```

Do not run tick, send notifications, mutate positions, sync Feishu, or deploy unless the user explicitly asks for that side effect.

### Futu quote and broker capability routing

Generic market facts use the effective Futu bindings from `symbols[].fetch`; account facts use the selected account's broker binding. These are separate authorities even when both resolve to the same OpenD process. Quote-only code must not construct a trade context, and broker-only code must not construct a quote context.

Before applying a multi-market or multi-account runtime configuration, validate all rendered configs together:

```bash
./om config validate \
  --config-path /path/to/config.us.json \
  --market us \
  --related-config-path /path/to/config.hk.json
```

The additive `futu_routing_audit.v1` result is read-only and contains masked account identities. It fails when quote bindings do not converge, one account drifts across runtime configs, multiple Futu accounts share a broker endpoint, required account IDs are incomplete, or an enabled direct trade-intake source differs from its broker binding. This validates configured endpoints only; production rollout must still prove that distinct broker endpoints map to distinct OpenD PIDs.

`healthcheck` reports typed `opend_quote_readiness_<endpoint>` and `opend_broker_readiness_<account>_<endpoint>` facts while preserving the legacy readiness summary projection. An account's primary Futu path depends on broker readiness, not quote readiness.

For explicit Control operation diagnosis, read the durable operation timeline:

```bash
./om-agent run --tool operation_timeline --input-json '{"limit":10}'
```

Copilot sessions, runs, and model/tool events are owned by the Copilot Host
store. Control audit rows must not be repackaged as synthetic Agent plans or
evidence sessions.

## 3. Tool Selection

Use the lowest-risk tool that can answer the question.

| Question | First tool or file | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Is the online run healthy? | `runtime_status` | Reads existing runtime artifacts without running pipelines |
| Can this environment run? | `healthcheck` | Validates readiness and dependencies |
| Did cron/tick decide to skip? | `scheduler_status`, `scheduler_decision.json` | Separates scheduler rules from cron execution |
| Why did a symbol disappear? | `symbol_resolve` if identity is unclear, then `candidate_filter_explain` | Uses sealed snapshot and trace evidence instead of guessing from a terminal candidate list |
| Why is candidate ranking odd? | `candidate_rank_explain` | Explains the sealed candidate snapshot ranking |
| Is shadow replay evidence ready for tuning? | `research collect --scope candidate` | Offline candidate/reject universe readiness; no live config mutation |
| Is candidate evidence complete enough for scan diagnosis? | `healthcheck` / `doctor` with `candidate_evidence` inputs | Diagnostic row-count/readiness check, not a strategy recommendation |
| Is Sell Put cash constrained? | `query_cash_headroom` | Account-aware cash and collateral view |
| Is ledger projection trustworthy? | `option_positions_read action=inspect`, Research `ledger` scope | Reads canonical event/projection state |
| Does close advice have inputs? | `prepare_close_advice_inputs`, then `close_advice` or `get_close_advice` | Keeps refresh and recommendation explicit |
| What evidence should MacBook Codex analyze? | `research` | Builds a redacted evidence bundle and handoff |

## 4. Research / Shadow Replay Workflow

Research and Shadow Replay are an independent offline evidence/replay module.
They are not Inbound Assistant core, not `./om-agent` tools, and not an online AI
product feature. The online/Linux side collects redacted evidence. MacBook Codex
reads the handoff and helps diagnose quality issues, ledger problems, and
strategy-improvement directions.

### Common Server Command

```bash
./om research collect \
  --config-key us \
  --scope full \
  --output both \
  --no-write-outputs
```

With scheduler evidence from the online job runner:

```bash
./om research collect \
  --config-key us \
  --scope full \
  --output both \
  --no-write-outputs \
  --scheduler-evidence-json '{"provider":"cron","job_name":"us-tick","last_run_id":"20260518T095446Z-2e7d54","last_triggered_at":"2026-05-18T09:54:46Z","last_status":"success","last_exit_code":0}'
```

With a readiness snapshot:

```bash
./om research collect \
  --config-key us \
  --scope full \
  --include-healthcheck \
  --no-write-outputs
```

To collect a payload-free storage and capacity baseline for a selected runtime
root:

```bash
./om research storage-baseline \
  --runtime-root /var/lib/options-monitor
```

The command traverses only the fixed runtime subroots, does not follow
symlinks, and never opens the source ledger. It copies the source SQLite
`db/wal/shm` set to a temporary directory after a bounded stability check, then
queries aggregate row/JSON-byte counts from that copy in `mode=ro` with
`query_only=ON`. Research payload bodies are neither read nor hashed: declared
manifest hashes and sizes are capacity metadata, while current content remains
`not_verified`. The payload-free account baseline is the count of immediate,
non-symlink directories under `output_accounts`; missing or unsafe roots remain
explicitly unavailable instead of being inferred from file counts.

Pass prior reports in chronological order to obtain a measured growth and
90-day forecast; one observation remains `insufficient_history`:

```bash
./om research storage-baseline \
  --runtime-root /var/lib/options-monitor \
  --history-report ./baseline-2026-06.json \
  --history-report ./baseline-2026-07.json \
  --output ./baseline-2026-08.json
```

`--output` writes one atomic local JSON file and must point outside the
inventoried runtime root. Existing output is refused unless `--overwrite` is
explicit. Capacity warnings and cold-candidate rows are read-only decision
previews; this command has no move, delete, compact, checkpoint, repair, or
notification action.

Canonical scan-blob garbage collection has a separate read-only preview:

```bash
./om research storage-gc-preview --runtime-root /var/lib/options-monitor
```

It keeps runs within 14 days or among the latest 200, verifies every blob
reachable from protected manifests, and reports only unreachable blobs older
than the 24-hour orphan grace period. Any invalid protected manifest or
missing/corrupt referenced blob suppresses all candidates. There is no confirm
or delete mode.

Historical cleanup has a separate gated preview:

```bash
./om research storage-cleanup-preview \
  --runtime-root /var/lib/options-monitor \
  --lifecycle-inventory ./lifecycle-migration-inventory.json \
  --quality-cutover-evidence ./quality-cutover-evidence.json \
  --backup-proof ./historical-cleanup-backup-proof.json \
  --history-report ./baseline-previous.json
```

The first run can omit `--backup-proof` to obtain
`expected_backup_bindings`; it remains `not_ready` and emits no candidates.
The proof must describe a standalone, integrity-checked SQLite backup whose
logical contents and projection/lifecycle bindings match the live ledger.
This command is preview-only: it never moves, deletes, vacuums, or rewrites
data, and it has no `--confirm` or `--delete` mode. Even a ready result only
authorizes a later operator decision. Legacy required-data CSV/base64 files,
ledger history rows, and research generation roots are explicitly excluded.
Actual cleanup requires separate authorization and an implemented write path.

Sealed required-data snapshots also publish one deterministic gzip payload per
symbol at
`output_shared/blobs/sha256/<first-two-hex>/<sha256>.json.gz`; the run's
`state/required_data_snapshot_manifest.json` is the commit/root that retains the
exact blob reference. During the compatibility window the producer still writes
the legacy JSON, CSV, and inline base64 fields. A sealed reader prefers the blob
when its reference exists, falls back only when the reference is absent, and
fails closed instead of hiding a bad reference with legacy data. Shadow Replay
surfaces payload-free `required_data_read_source_counts` and
`required_data_legacy_read_count`; archive collection transfers only blob hashes
reachable from selected run roots, never the whole shared blob store.

The frozen consumer boundary is deliberate: ordinary scan/filter steps receive
the single frame materialized by the sealed snapshot resolver; Close Advice,
Daily Brief, Shadow Replay, and Strategy Lab consume the same sealed bytes.
Prefetch, multiplier enrichment, coverage checks, quote-cache validation, and
request-local materialization tools operate before sealing and therefore still
use their producer workspace. Archive CSV checks are legacy-presence checks,
while archive retention and replay use manifest blob references.

The Phase 6 storage harness uses a checked-in metadata-only p99 descriptor and
deterministic synthetic rows; it has no production-runtime input:

```bash
./.venv/bin/python scripts/benchmark_required_data_scan_blobs.py \
  --profile canonical --output docs/gateflow/scan-blob-canonical-performance.json
./.venv/bin/python scripts/benchmark_required_data_scan_blobs.py \
  --profile dual_output --output docs/gateflow/scan-blob-dual-output-performance.json
```

The default 5 warmups and 30 repetitions are the formal labels. Lower counts
are plumbing smoke only. Formal benchmark receipts remain gitignored process
evidence and are not source-release artifacts.

To measure the current canonical position projector and the real SQLite full-
replay writer on deterministic synthetic data:

```bash
./.venv/bin/python scripts/benchmark_data_storage_projection.py \
  --baseline ./baseline-2026-08.json \
  --scenario all \
  --output-dir ./projection-benchmark-2026-08
```

The output directory must be absent or empty. The runner never opens a runtime
ledger: it derives bounded dimensions from aggregate baseline metadata, creates
fresh temporary SQLite ledgers, and atomically publishes `fixture-manifest.json`,
`timing.json`, `cpu-profile.json`, `allocation-profile.json`, and
`decision.json`, plus `phase-3a-acceptance.json`. Omit `--baseline` to use
deterministic safe defaults.

Timing uses 5 warmups and 30 measured repetitions by default. Lower values are
allowed for plumbing checks but are labeled `non_acceptance_smoke`. `cProfile`
and `tracemalloc` run in separate child processes and therefore never influence
the threshold timing. The `history_10x` result contains both a fixed-output
history-cost case and a retained-closed-lot case, each with at least 10,000
events. It also measures `research_storage_status.history_10x` against a
deterministic 10,000-partition manifest fixture. Fixture construction and module
imports are outside the storage timing/allocation scope; the decision freezes
p95 wall at 5 seconds and Python peak allocation at 64 MiB while preserving
zero payload-content reads and zero runtime mutations. Use
`--scenario research_storage_status` to run only that component.

Absolute p95 wall/CPU decisions require an exact host-profile match, including
separate CPU and hardware-model fields. First run
without a reference to record the `host_fingerprint`; only a deliberately
designated reference run should repeat with:

```bash
./.venv/bin/python scripts/benchmark_data_storage_projection.py \
  --scenario history_10x \
  --reference-host-fingerprint <recorded-sha256> \
  --output-dir ./projection-benchmark-reference
```

Without an exact match, timing is still reported but the writer gate is
`not_comparable`. `projector_only` is diagnostic evidence, not a writer pass.
For checkpoint/tail acceptance, first produce a passing read-only shadow
manifest for the exact target store, then run:

```bash
./.venv/bin/python scripts/benchmark_data_storage_projection.py \
  --scenario phase_3a \
  --reference-host-fingerprint <recorded-sha256> \
  --shadow-manifest ./projection-shadow.json \
  --output-dir ./projection-benchmark-phase3a
```

Only the default 5 warmups / 30 repetitions on the exact reference host can
produce `lot_diff_publication=pass`, `checkpoint_tail=pass`, combined
`ready`, and a passing acceptance manifest. The benchmark uses synthetic
ledgers and never applies a migration or enables a runtime store. The
`retained_lots_10x` fingerprint result is a capacity diagnostic with
`retained_lots_10x_guarantee=false`, not a hidden activation gate.

### Scopes

| Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ledger` | Trade intake, position maintenance, and ledger quality evidence |
| `candidate` | Per-account candidate evidence, ranking samples, filter traces, Combo Yield pair rejection funnel / nearest misses, and shadow replay readiness |
| `quality` | Runtime freshness, latest run status, scheduler evidence, optional healthcheck |
| `full` | Combined default |

Research reads candidate facts only from manifest-bound opening/Combo/CC+LP snapshots. `candidate_filter_trace.jsonl` may supplement rejection evidence but cannot create a candidate universe. Historical CSV-only runs are reported as unsupported and their CSV bytes are never parsed.

For offline strategy evidence review, inspect `candidate_evidence.shadow_replay` in the Research bundle, especially `review_readiness`. It is a readiness and analysis surface only; it cannot mutate scanner config. To compare how a concrete threshold hypothesis would change the observed candidate set, use `./om research shadow-replay candidate-impact-report --params <params.json>` or `--params-dir <dir>` against either an existing dataset or a `--profile-path` / date window; it writes paired JSON and Markdown candidate-impact reports. The underlying comparison stays inside `observed_run_universe`: if the requested start date has no scan artifacts, it must report coverage failure instead of reconstructing a historical option chain.

Default runs do not write files. Writing reports through `./om research collect`
requires `--write-outputs --confirm`. Default output locations are:

```text
output_shared/research/
output_shared/state/current/research.current.json
output_shared/research/shadow_replay/
```

MacBook SSH pattern:

```bash
ssh prod 'cd /path/to/options-monitor && ./om research collect \
  --config-key us \
  --scope full \
  --output handoff \
  --no-write-outputs' \
| ./.venv/bin/python -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["data"]["handoff_markdown"])'
```

## 5. Runtime Evidence Map

Important runtime paths:

| Artifact | Path |
|---|---|
| Shared state | `output_shared/state/` |
| Current pointers | `output_shared/state/current/` |
| Per-account output | `output_accounts/<account>/` |
| Run snapshots | `output_runs/<run_id>/` |
| Compact runtime shadow | `output_runs/<run_id>/accounts/<account>/state/runtime_portfolio_snapshot.v1.json` |
| Default reports | `output_shared/reports/` |
| OpenD cache | `cache/opend_option_chain/`, `cache/opend_option_expirations/` |
| Audit logs | `audit/run_logs/` |

For runtime questions, prefer `runtime_status` because it already knows how to summarize these paths and distinguish latest run from latest scanned run.

## 6. Module Ownership

### Candidate Scanning

- Domain engine: `domain/domain/engine/candidate_engine.py`
- Application adapters: `src/application/candidate_scanning.py`, `src/application/scan_sell_put.py`, `src/application/scan_sell_call.py`
- Rule: do not add parallel ranking logic in application adapters.

Core domain functions:

```python
def evaluate_candidate_input(row: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]: ...
def evaluate_candidate_hard_constraints(payload: dict[str, Any], constraints: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]: ...
def evaluate_candidate_return_floor(payload: dict[str, Any], constraints: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]: ...
def evaluate_candidate_risk_filter(payload: dict[str, Any], constraints: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]: ...
def rank_candidate_rows(rows: list[dict[str, Any]], *, mode: StrategyMode | str) -> list[dict[str, Any]]: ...
```

### Candidate Diagnostics

- Candidate ranking explanation: `src/application/agent_tools/candidate_rank_impl.py`
- Filter trace explanation: `src/application/agent_tools/candidate_filter_impl.py`
- Candidate evidence readiness: `healthcheck` / `doctor` `candidate_evidence` check
- Docs: `docs/candidate_strategy.md`

For "why did this symbol/account not get a candidate", start from `candidate_filter_explain` and the manifest-bound snapshot/trace evidence. If the user gives a Chinese name or alias, resolve it with `symbol_resolve` or pass the raw alias to `candidate_filter_explain`; `account` is scan scope, not symbol identity. Both candidate explanation tools validate the terminal manifest before reading the opening owner. A missing manifest or a latest run that has started but is not terminal fails closed; the tools never skip it to explain an older snapshot. Only pass an explicit `run_id` for manual forensics of a known terminal run.

For offline strategy evidence review, collect a candidate-scoped Research bundle first:

```bash
./om research collect --config-key us --scope candidate --run-id <run-id> --output json --no-write-outputs --shadow-replay-min-sample 30
```

Treat the shadow replay payload as offline evidence. If it lacks rejected samples, mark path snapshots, or outcome facts, it is not ready for manual strategy review and must not mutate production scanner config, Feishu, trade state, or notifications.

When remote storage is constrained, use `./om research archive pull --remote prod --ssh-target <host> --require-replay-evidence` first. The default local archive is `output_shared/research/remote_archive/prod/`; `pull` is dry-run unless `--write` is passed. `--require-replay-evidence` filters out scheduler skip / tick heartbeat directories and selects runs with sealed candidate snapshots/status or `candidate_filter_trace.jsonl`; legacy candidate filenames are classification metadata only. After `./om research archive verify --remote prod`, use `./om research archive build-datasets --remote prod --market us --write` to create local Shadow Replay datasets; `--market` uses validated snapshot/manifest identity. Dataset build writes an initial scan-time mark from archived run `required_data/parsed` when present, but final outcome evidence still requires later path/expiry marks and `settle`. Only use `archive prune-remote --confirm` after the local `inventory.latest.json` proves every planned remote `output_runs` deletion has been verified locally.

For an explicit local dataset, use `./om research shadow-replay build --run-id <run-id>`, then inspect `./om research shadow-replay status --min-sample 30 --min-mark-points 2 --mark-stale-hours 24` to see each dataset's next data-lifecycle action. `data_plan` contains only executable data-maintenance actions (`collect_marks` / `settle`), while `review_queue` lists datasets ready for explicit manual `analyze`. Use `./om research shadow-replay run-data-plan` as the independent low-frequency maintenance entry: it is dry-run by default with no receipt write, and only `--write` executes eligible `collect_marks` / `settle` actions and writes a local receipt. It must not execute `analyze`; manual review stays on the explicit `analyze` command. Collect path samples with `./om research shadow-replay collect-marks --dataset <dataset-dir> --source local --write` or explicit OpenD sampling via `--source opend --write`. OpenD sampling refreshes local required-data cache before appending this point-in-time mark, and may update local OpenD rate-limit state / option-chain cache; it cannot recover past option marks that were never collected. OpenD preview without `--write` uses temporary paths and does not persist those files. You can still run the lower-level `mark`, `settle`, and `analyze` commands directly. Build, local collect, mark, and settle only write local replay evidence; OpenD collect also writes local evidence/cache files only. Missing required-data quotes are recorded as `missing_quote` evidence gaps and are not usable marks; expiry spot-only marks can be used for expiration outcome facts.

Each Shadow Replay manifest binds an immutable generation under the dataset's `generations/` directory. Generations reuse content-addressed partitions under `partitions/sha256/`; the mutable JSONL files remain compatibility views, while Strategy Lab evidence stays bound to the exact generation it used. Do not delete old generation manifests or partitions directly; use the storage status and preview surfaces so referenced evidence remains recoverable.

Use `outcome_by_bucket` from the analysis output to review DTE, Delta, IV/RV, spread, and concentration buckets before proposing filter or ranking changes.

### Tick Runtime

- Orchestration spine: `src/application/multi_account_tick.py`
- Helper modules:
  - `tick_run_context`: idempotency bucket/key and completion records
  - `tick_guard_flow`: project guard, load shedding, market filter, OpenD phone-verify gate, watchdog admission
  - `tick_run_workspace`: run directory, required-data workspace, shared state pointer, immutable per-run account config authority
  - `tick_scheduler_context`: trading-day guard, scheduler state path, scheduler decision
  - `tick_account_execution`: account defaults, worker limits, ordered concurrent execution, account metrics
  - `tick_notification_flow`: notification prep, quiet-hour decision, delivery, metrics, finalization

Tick flow:

```text
./om run tick --config <runtime-config.json>  # manual scan; no ordinary Tick auto-send
-> src.application.multi_account_tick.run_tick
   -> tick_guard_flow
   -> tick_scheduler_context
   -> tick_account_execution
      -> canonical account config write-once/adopt under `output_runs/<run_id>/accounts/<account>/`
      -> expired position maintenance
      -> required_data prefetch
      -> pipeline_runtime / pipeline_watchlist / pipeline_symbol
      -> optional close advice
      -> immutable compact runtime shadow after terminal candidate commit
      -> per-account metrics and notification text
   -> tick_notification_flow  # scheduled only: Daily Decision Brief ordinary delivery
   -> run state and audit writes
```

For each account, Tick serializes the effective runtime config once before prepared workers or account execution. The
authoritative input is `output_runs/<run_id>/accounts/<account>/state/config.override.json`; the sibling
`output_runs/<run_id>/accounts/<account>/config.override.json` is a byte-identical compatibility artifact. Both are
write-once/adopt and bound to the same SHA-256. Before shared planning or provider I/O, Tick validates both files against
the parent-retained canonical bytes; a mismatch makes that account terminal for the run. After this final barrier, all
parent and scan-child consumers use the retained generation instead of reopening mutable paths, so a later path
replacement cannot split one run across two configs. Account labels are canonical lowercase path components
(`[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}`); an explicit empty scope, unsafe label, or symlinked artifact ancestor fails closed before
run artifacts or config publication.

After a scanned account commits its terminal candidate manifest, Tick publishes the account-scoped compact runtime
snapshot above with write-once/adopt semantics. It is replay evidence and a shadow comparison surface only: legacy
files, `AccountResult`, ranking, notification, and delivery remain authoritative. Missing, malformed, or conflicting
compact data is reported as account-scoped `data_unavailable` and never repaired or substituted into the legacy path;
rollback is removal of the compact consumer/call, not a history rewrite or runtime-data deletion.

Prepared portfolio payloads use content-addressed names and a write-once/adopt manifest. The parent retains the manifest
SHA-256 and passes it to the final scan child; both consumers therefore load the same prepared generation. The loader
anchors manifest and payload reads to the expected runtime root/run/account through a no-follow directory chain, checks
the account-config SHA-256, and verifies the resolved portfolio source account against `filters.account` and any account
declared by holding rows. External-holdings contexts bind to the configured `holdings_account`, not implicitly to the OM
account label. A config or prepared-authority failure is isolated to its account; healthy accounts remain eligible for
shared planning and required-data prefetch.
Historical `output_accounts/<account>/state/config.override.json` files are preserved for forensics but are not read or
written as Tick input authority.

Direct `run tick` calls, including `--force`, still produce scan/run artifacts but do not auto-send ordinary Tick notifications. Use the guarded `run tick-cron` entry for scheduled ordinary delivery. `symbols_notification.txt` is a Compact compatibility bundle that may also contain candidate rejection summary and Close Advice sections; it is not evidence that a Daily Brief was prepared or sent. Public runtime reads expose it canonically as `compatibility_notification` with `authority=compatibility_only` and `delivery_evidence=false`; the old `notification` fields are deprecated Phase A/B aliases scheduled for removal in Phase C.

The `scheduler` command is decision/mark-only. Its legacy `--run-if-due` flag remains parseable for compatibility but returns `UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION` without reading runtime config/state or starting a child process. Use `./om run tick ...` for explicit scans and `./om run tick-cron ...` for guarded scheduled execution.

Entrypoint signature:

```python
def run_tick(argv: list[str] | None = None) -> int: ...
```

### Ledger, Positions, And Trades

Canonical chain:

```text
trade_events
-> domain.domain.ledger.projection
-> position_lots
-> SQLite projection
```

Ownership:

| Area | Files |
|---|---|
| Domain projection | `domain/domain/ledger/projection.py` |
| Public application boundary | `src/application/ledger/api.py` |
| Use-case commands | `src/application/ledger/commands.py` |
| Repository/config boundary | `src/application/ledger/repository.py` |
| Stored event codec | `src/application/ledger/event_codec.py` |
| Event write and projection publish | `src/application/ledger/writer.py` |
| Manual trades | `src/application/ledger/manual_trades.py` |
| Void/repair interventions | `src/application/ledger/interventions.py` |
| Auto-close maintenance | `src/application/ledger/maintenance.py`, `src/application/positions/auto_close.py` |
| Position-facing workflows | `src/application/positions/` |
| Trade-facing workflows | `src/application/trades/` |

Core projection functions:

```python
def project_trade_events(events: list[TradeEvent]) -> ProjectionResult: ...
def build_risk_position_views(lots: list[PositionLot]) -> list[RiskPositionView]: ...
```

Rules:

- Local SQLite `trade_events` is the source of truth.
- Feishu `option_positions` is retired and must not be used for bootstrap, sync, or strategy reads.
- Non-ledger runtime code must enter through `src/application/ledger/api.py`.
- Do not patch projected state directly when the canonical event chain is wrong.

#### Current projection authority and resumable checkpoints

`trade_events` remains the canonical history and `position_lots` remains the
authoritative current projection. A row in `position_projection_checkpoints`
is only a bounded resumable cache: it stores active continuation state, never
replaces event history, and cannot authorize a read unless source/head/schema/
implementation generations match exactly.

Ordinary append-safe writers may resume from the newest trusted checkpoint and
apply only its ordered tail. Explicit rebuild, audit, historical allocation,
Strategy Lab, backtest, void/repair, unsafe ordering, or any trust mismatch use
the canonical full history. Therefore checkpoint activation does not reduce
research or backtest fidelity and does not delete closed lots or events.

Checkpoint cadence is fixed in code: rotate after 100 tail events or 1 MiB of
canonical tail bytes, whichever comes first. Ordinary writes between rotations
write no checkpoint payload. Retention keeps at most the newest two trusted
checkpoints plus the newest distinct full-oracle seed (`K <= 3`).

Read-only operator surfaces:

```bash
./om option-positions --data-config <data.json> projection-migration inventory
./om option-positions --data-config <data.json> projection-migration verify --shadow
./om option-positions --data-config <data.json> projection-migration status
```

`inventory` and `verify --shadow` open the selected SQLite store read-only.
`status` reports checkpoint mode/K/bytes, source and lot generations, last full
verification, loaded implementation fingerprint timing, fingerprint rows/
bytes, and bounded process-local fast/full/fallback wall/CPU summaries.
`source_generation_mismatch`, `lots_generation_mismatch`, schema-cookie or
implementation mismatch, an untrusted/missing checkpoint, or parity failure
means the trusted path is unavailable; use full `verify`/rebuild and generate
fresh evidence rather than overriding the reason.

Write transitions are deliberately separate and require both the normal local
write guard and high-risk confirmation:

```bash
./om option-positions --data-config <data.json> projection-migration apply \
  --manifest <inventory.json> --apply --confirm
./om option-positions --data-config <data.json> projection-migration activate \
  --acceptance-manifest <phase-3a-acceptance.json> \
  --shadow-manifest <projection-shadow.json> --apply --confirm
./om option-positions --data-config <data.json> projection-migration deactivate \
  --apply --confirm
```

`apply` backfills/indexes and seeds a trusted checkpoint but leaves mode
disabled. `activate` requires exact current-store, source-commit, schema,
implementation, generation, reference-host, benchmark, and shadow bindings.
`deactivate` disables checkpoint use without deleting events, lots, heads, or
checkpoints. Merging this source does not authorize a live apply/activate,
release, deployment, service change, notification, broker write, or deletion;
each remains a separate explicit operator action.

#### Option Performance And Portfolio Bridges

Primary read entry points:

```bash
./om option-performance report --config-key us --account lx --period mtd
./om option-performance report --config-key us --account lx --period ytd --as-of-date 2026-07-17
./om option-performance cash-conversion backfill --config-key us --account lx --start-date 2026-04-01 --end-date 2026-07-24
./om-agent run --tool option_performance_report --input-json '{"config_key":"us","account":"lx","period":"month","month":"2026-06"}'
PORTFOLIO_SERVICE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8765 ./om-agent run --tool portfolio_pnl_bridge --input-json '{"period":"mtd","as_of_month":"2026-07","accounts":["lx","sy"]}'
PORTFOLIO_SERVICE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8765 ./om-agent run --tool portfolio_cash_bridge --input-json '{"period":"mtd","as_of_month":"2026-07","accounts":["lx","sy"]}'
```

Use the metric namespace that matches the question:

- profit / earnings -> `pnl.period_total_net` or an explicit gross/realized variant;
- cash movement -> `cash.total_cash_change_net` and its six components;
- premium activity -> `activity.premium_collected_gross`;
- capital efficiency -> the explicit `capital.*_annualized_efficiency` fields only.

`premium_collected_gross` is not additional profit. Assignment stock principal is cash movement and an asset conversion, not option PnL. Missing fee, mark, or FX evidence stays partial/null and must never be replaced with zero. A configured account scope with no events is a proven observed zero; an arbitrary unconfigured scope remains `not_observed`.

Cash backfill reads persisted event-time FX evidence, defaults to dry-run, and
requires `--apply` for the atomic ledger enrichment plus audit receipt. It
never replaces an already observed `cash_conversion.v1`.

`monthly_income_report`, `./om option-positions report monthly-income`, and
`portfolio_capital_bridge` have been removed. Do not recreate their ambiguous
`net_income_cny` or generic return fields. The migration note is historical
mapping only, not a callable rollback path.

#### Historical Trade Receipt Compensation

Use the guarded compensation mode only when an already-recorded open trade has
the legacy false `outbox_managed` receipt marker and current evidence proves
there was no durable outbox ID or confirmed provider message. Preview is the
default and neither sends nor writes:

```bash
./om run trade-intake --config /var/lib/options-monitor/config.us.json \
  --runtime-root /var/lib/options-monitor --compensate-receipts \
  --account lx \
  --deal-id futu:lx:<futu_account_id>:<deal_id_1> \
  --deal-id futu:lx:<futu_account_id>:<deal_id_2> \
  --dry-run
```

After reviewing the frozen message, exact member list, route fingerprint,
delivery key, and `payload_hash`, the high-risk form requires `--apply`,
`--confirm` (or `--yes`), and the reviewed value as
`--expected-payload-hash <sha256>`. Any change to the members, message, or route
fails closed and requires a new preview. Apply sends one combined historical
receipt, never replays trade events or edits `position_lots`, and writes an
independent content-addressed record under the source account's
`receipt_compensations/` directory plus an audit event. A confirmed rerun is
duplicate-suppressed. A prepared, send-started, accepted, unknown, or otherwise
unconfirmed record is also frozen and must not be automatically resent.

### Close Advice

- Domain policy: `domain/domain/close_advice.py`
- Runner/I/O assembly: `src/application/close_advice_runner.py`
- Recommended agent entry: `get_close_advice`
- Contract: `docs/CLOSE_ADVICE_CONTRACT.md`

Core domain functions:

```python
def evaluate_close_advice(inp: CloseAdviceInput) -> dict[str, Any]: ...
```

The domain has one fixed `strict_profit_capture.v1` policy for short puts and
short calls. It returns only `close`, `hold`, or `not_evaluable`. The runner
loads sealed position/quote facts, preserves fail-closed rows, and formats the
report; it does not pair opening candidates or make replacement decisions.

Scheduled Tick runs use one immutable required-data barrier for Close Advice:

- Coverage policy v2 evaluates each planned `request x option_type x expiration`
  scope. A scope with no filtered contracts is complete only when the producer's
  `option_chain_scope_coverage.v1` evidence binds an empty code set to a current
  `cache` or `fetched` chain result. Scope and contract-code order are not
  semantic identity; duplicate or mismatched request/type/expiration identities
  remain invalid. A fully observed filtered-empty plan is `success_empty` unless
  an exact held strike is required. Missing requested snapshots, exact held
  strikes, and stale/error provider outcomes remain fail-closed. Unexpected
  snapshot codes are quarantined outside consumer rows and reported as warnings.
  Artifacts without scope evidence retain the legacy strict numeric-boundary
  coverage behavior.

- Before the single cross-account prefetch, enabled accounts contribute exact active position requirements to `output_runs/<run_id>/state/close_advice_required_data_plan.json`. Disabled accounts are `not_applicable` and are not part of the readiness denominator.
- Candidate demand owns an already-selected symbol fetch route. A position requirement may join that route only when its resolved source, host, and port match; conflicting or ambiguous requirements become typed `required_data_route_conflict` gaps and never create a second fetch.
- `required_data_snapshot_manifest.json` binds the requirements-plan path and hashes. Re-entry restores that binding from the manifest instead of rereading the ledger or rebuilding requirements.
- Scheduled Close Advice receives `quote_mode=frozen_snapshot` and may only read sealed required-data bytes and receipts. It performs zero OpenD fallback calls, cache repairs, or required-data writes. Missing coverage is a per-position `not_evaluable` gap; manifest, plan, receipt, or payload integrity failure invalidates the account pipeline and suppresses its normal Daily Brief.
- Each Close Advice CSV row carries the snapshot-plan, manifest, requirement-plan, route-binding, snapshot, receipt, payload, observation-time, and expiry identifiers needed to trace the decision to its frozen inputs.

The legacy mutable runner mode remains available to direct compatibility
callers, but it is not the scheduled Tick authority. There is no portfolio
allocator, replacement/reallocation plan, v2 authority, promotion state, or
notification token around Close Advice.

### Notifications

- Per-account content: `src/application/notify_symbols.py`
- Multi-account wrapper: `src/application/multi_tick/notify_format.py`
- Shared System Notice / Receipt presentation shell: `src/application/notification_shells.py`
- Preview tool: `preview_notification`
- Perception audit card: `assistant_perception` events written by
  `src/application/tick_notification_flow.py`
- Read tool: `notification_perception_read`

Notification text should remain Markdown-friendly and operationally direct. The
business renderer owns one canonical flat Markdown string. Scheduled Feishu App
Daily Brief delivery also persists a digest-verified Card JSON 2.0 transport
projection of that same decision view; retries must reuse the frozen envelope
and logical idempotency key. WeChat ClawBot sends the canonical flat string
unchanged through `text_item.text`. Channel adapters may select the persisted
transport projection but must not independently recalculate business content.

Scheduled ordinary delivery has one renderer authority: Daily Decision Brief. `preview_notification` is read-only and defaults to the Compact compatibility renderer; its output always reports `authority=compatibility_only` and `delivery_evidence=false`. Explicit `render_style=legacy` remains temporarily available only for compatibility inspection and returns a deprecation warning. Neither preview renderer may be used as a scheduled fallback.

System notices use `# OM · 系统通知 · <component>` and receipts use `# OM · 回执 · <account>` plus `类型｜成交` or `类型｜持仓维护`. `notification_shells.py` owns only the flat Markdown H1/field/section layout. OpenD rate limits and recovery, delivery-failure aggregation/retry, trade receipt warnings, and maintenance receipt status/dedupe/persistence remain with their existing callers; the shell must not send, retry, inspect provider byte limits, or classify business state.

Card delivery may fall back to the canonical Feishu `post` projection only
after a definite permanent Card rejection and only when the complete Card
attempt history proves that no transient or ambiguous send occurred. The
fallback uses a distinct `<transport-key>:fallback` UUID and records both the
logical and effective keys. Any timeout, transient response, unknown outcome,
or duplicate risk freezes the original envelope and requires evidence-based
resolution; it must never switch UUID or confirm the Daily Brief. Feishu post
delivery measures the exact final outer JSON request body as UTF-8 before token
acquisition or message HTTP. Requests over the fixed 28 KiB local budget fail
closed as `FEISHU_POST_TOO_LARGE` and are not truncated, fragmented, retried, or
automatically replayed.

Notification perception events are compressed system evidence for Assistant
follow-ups. They record delivery action/reason, accounts, symbol summaries,
message lengths and hashes, but not raw notification text or webhook secrets.
They may enter ClawBot conversation context as `system_event` evidence; they
must not be treated as user messages or as authorization to write config, send
notifications, or mutate broker-facing state.

### Configuration

- YAML authoring: `src/application/config_yaml.py`, `src/application/config_yaml_init.py`
- Runtime snapshot validation: `src/application/config_validator.py`
- Legacy JSON migration reader: `src/application/layered_config.py`
- Examples: `configs/examples/config.yaml.example`, `configs/examples/user.example.us.json`, `configs/examples/user.example.hk.json`
- Full config docs: `CONFIGS.md`, `CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md`

`config.yaml` is the human authoring surface. `config.us.json` and `config.hk.json` are generated runtime snapshots consumed by tick/agent tools. Legacy JSON user overlays are one-time `config migrate-yaml` inputs only, not an upgrade-recovery path; production upgrade fails closed when the YAML authoring source is unavailable.

Do not weaken production config validation to make local tests pass. Fix the config path, test fixture, or validation contract instead.

### Tool Gateway Tools

- Tool modules: `src/application/agent_tools/<domain>.py`
- Manifest collector: `src/application/agent_tool_registry.py`
- Write permission gate: `src/application/agent_tools/permissions.py`
- Contracts: `src/application/agent_tool_contracts.py`
- Config helpers: `src/application/agent_tool_config.py`, `src/application/agent_tool_init_local.py`
- CLI: `src/interfaces/agent/cli.py` -> `./om-agent`

When adding or changing a tool, put the implementation and manifest metadata in
the owning `agent_tools` domain module, then update focused tests and docs
together. Root-level `src/application/agent_tool_*.py` files, except shared
config/contract/registry helpers, are compatibility re-export shims only. Do
not reintroduce a central handler switchboard.

## 7. Import Constraints

```text
domain/domain/        -> MUST NOT import src/ or scripts/
src/application/      -> MUST NOT import scripts/
src/infrastructure/   -> external adapters and persistence details
src/interfaces/       -> CLI/agent adaptation
scripts/              -> operational wrappers only; delegate to src/ or domain/
```

## 8. Common Investigation Playbooks

### Online Quality Looks Bad

1. Read `runtime_status`.
2. Add scheduler evidence if the issue involves cron or online jobs.
3. Collect `research` handoff with `scope=full`.
4. Inspect findings: scheduler, freshness, account failures, prefetch, notifications, maintenance, trade intake.
5. Only then decide whether to run focused local tests or modify code.

### A Symbol Is Missing

1. Get run/account/symbol from the user or runtime artifact.
2. Resolve natural-language or alias symbols with `symbol_resolve` when needed.
3. Run `candidate_filter_explain`.
4. Compare market-level candidate evidence with account-level filters.
5. If account constraints are involved, inspect cash, holdings, and cost basis with `query_cash_headroom` and position tools.
6. Add a focused regression test around the leaking boundary if behavior is wrong.

### Multi-Account Strategy Behavior Looks Wrong

1. Confirm accounts are lowercase and present in runtime config.
2. Read `scheduler_status` per account.
3. Inspect `tick_metrics` through `runtime_status`.
4. Use `research` `candidate` or `full` scope for candidate/filter trace evidence.
5. Separate expected account constraints from state contamination.

### Ledger Or Trade Intake Looks Wrong

1. Use `option_positions_read action=inspect` or `action=events`.
2. Follow `trade_events -> projection -> position_lots`.
3. Check trade intake summaries and unresolved/failed counts in `runtime_status`.
4. Use semantic repair/void workflows; do not hand-edit projected rows.
5. Verify with focused ledger tests.

### Release Request

Development delivery and release publication are separate:

- `commit and push` / `提交并推送` means validate, commit, and push the named development change. Update
  `CHANGELOG.md / Unreleased` when the change belongs in user-facing release notes, but do not modify
  `VERSION`, create a tag or Release, or upgrade production.
- `merge main` / `合并 main` integrates a complete, green change into the next release candidate. It still
  does not publish or deploy a version.
- `release` / `发布` means prepare and publish the VERSION-driven GitHub Release. It does not upgrade
  production unless the request explicitly includes the remote upgrade.
- `release and upgrade` / `发布并升级远端` includes the controlled production upgrade and post-upgrade
  runtime verification.

When the user explicitly asks to publish a release, execute the full publication bundle:

1. Confirm intended file set with `git status --short`.
2. Review all commits since the latest release tag against `CHANGELOG.md / Unreleased`.
3. Preview the automatic version recommendation.
4. Generate `release/coverage/v<version>.json` with `scripts/release_delta.py`; map every release
   note to commit SHA(s), and give every truly non-user-visible commit an explicit reason.
5. Move `Unreleased` items into the dated target-version section and update `VERSION`.
6. Preview rendered release notes and run focused tests plus strict release checks with
   `--require-delta-coverage`.
7. Commit only `VERSION`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and the coverage manifest as
   `chore: release <version>`.
8. Push `main`.
9. Watch the `Release from VERSION` workflow.
10. Verify the GitHub Release, remote tag, target commit, and assets.

The coverage gate uses the previous stable tag as the baseline. It requires every commit in the
delta to map to an exact Changelog item or an explicit `no_release_note` reason, and rejects code
commits added after the reviewed head. It records review disposition; it does not infer public
semantics from commit messages.

Use supported `gh release view --json` fields such as `tagName`, `name`, `url`, `publishedAt`, `targetCommitish`, `isDraft`, and `isPrerelease`.

## 10. Documentation Rules

- `AGENTS.md`: compact, stable, high-signal context for agents.
- `docs/AGENT_WIKI.md`: this task manual and code ownership map.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: current system architecture and entry boundaries.
- `docs/INBOUND_CONTROL.md`: controlled channel message entry boundary.
- `docs/TOOL_REFERENCE.md`: public `om-agent` Tool Gateway contract and examples.
- `docs/AGENT_INTEGRATION.md`: Tool Gateway JSON envelope and integration contract.
- `README.md`: human-facing product overview plus common operator commands.
- `RUNBOOK.md`: production cron, maintenance, and emergency operations.

When a public command, payload field, output path, or safety boundary changes, update the docs in the same change.

## 11. Archived Memory Reference

The `memory/` tree is archived project reference material, not an active LLM wiki workflow.

Use it only when a task needs historical context or prior decisions. Start from `memory/index.md`, open only relevant entries, and verify drift-prone facts against current source, tests, config, docs, or runtime artifacts before acting.

Do not use memory as a standing ingest target. Normal work should not add entries, update `memory/index.md`, append to `memory/log.md`, or use archived templates. Prefer updating current docs, tests, or runtime read surfaces when behavior or boundaries change.

## 12. Handoff Template

Use this shape when handing work to another agent or future session:

```markdown
## Goal
What the user wanted.

## Current State
Files changed, tests run, known dirty unrelated files.

## Decisions
Why the chosen path fits the repo boundaries.

## Evidence
Commands, outputs, runtime artifacts, or failing tests.

## Next Steps
Smallest remaining actions, with blockers called out.
```

## Option notification read and delivery model

`daily_decision_brief.v1` is the immutable account+market+trading-date successful-scan model. Delivery v2 separately owns fixed-target confirmation, pending/alerted candidate identities, and exact retry envelopes.

- Renderer authority: scheduled automatic ordinary notifications use Daily Brief only. Compact/Legacy has no scheduled sender authority. The deprecated `notifications.daily_brief.enabled` key is accepted with a stable warning during compatibility but its value does not change routing.
- Scheduler: keep the 10-minute wake-up. Canonical scans run only at `09:40`, eligible whole hours, eligible `HH:30`, and `15:50`; `09:30`, lunch breaks, and other wake-ups do not scan. A process failure relies on a later eligible scheduler slot; it does not invent an off-schedule retry scan.
- Fixed reports: `09:40`, eligible whole hours, and `15:50` prepare a full user report even with no candidates. A fixed failure prepares an explicit failure report and never projects the previous successful current as this round's result.
- Candidate alerts: eligible half-hour successful scans send immediately only when `current candidate identities - alerted identities` is non-empty. If fixed-report and new-candidate conditions coincide, the single complete fixed report wins.
- Trigger safety: manual/force reliable scans may advance the successful current snapshot for later query and candidate recovery, but they do not create an ordinary delivery envelope, resolve a provider route, or send an ordinary notification. Scheduled display uses the structured target; manual/force never infer a batch from reason text.
- Persistence order: durable successful outcome or fixed-failure evidence plus exact envelope -> exact scheduled-target watermark -> provider send -> attempt/ambiguous/confirmed transition.
- Retry: no-scan wake-ups may replay only an already persisted exact envelope. They must not run broker access, pipeline, assembler, candidate detection, revision persistence, or message re-rendering.
- Successful current: ready/degraded reliable scans advance current; failed/blocked/no-op scans do not. Query always reads the latest successful current, never the last delivered message.
- Close Advice projection: structured positions retain every evaluated holding for the total count, but only priced `recommendation_state=close` rows enter Daily Brief actions, ordered deterministically and capped by `max_items_per_account`. `hold` rows stay silent; quote/evaluation gaps remain explicit data-quality evidence rather than recommendations.
- Funds: render `cash_total_by_currency`, `option_opening_available_by_currency`, and candidate-scoped capacity. Never display total assets, NAV, securities market value, or `0` for unknown funds. Sell Put capacities share account cash and cannot be summed.
- Time and identity: scheduled batch and actual data-as-of are separate renderer inputs. Transient display time does not enter the persisted brief digest, candidate identity, or delivery confirmation pointer.
- Candidate event authority: user event facts come only from the same run's `output_runs/<run_id>/state/event_snapshot.json`. Missing, malformed, stale, partial, conflicting, or degraded evidence remains unable-to-confirm; it never falls back to candidate CSV compatibility fields and never changes candidate identity, ranking, eligibility, or capacity.
- User projection: fixed report, candidate alert, fixed failure, and query share the Daily Brief human contract. Markdown hides revision, internal IDs, broker codes, raw enums, raw ISO timestamps, paths, and rejection dumps while structured artifacts retain them.
- Query scope: latest accepts optional account and market. Missing filters are resolved from canonical `config.us.json` / `config.hk.json`, then rendered by account and market without combining funds. Day/revision reads remain explicit operator queries requiring an account; market keeps the existing US default when omitted.
- Query safety: query is byte-for-byte read-only with respect to delivery state and does not refresh data, scan, send, confirm, or mutate candidate state.
- Delivery ambiguity: ambiguous envelopes are frozen. Later attempts either replay the exact message/key/hash under the provider idempotency contract or wait for explicit confirmation.
- Multi-market: an explicit combined-market tick is terminal fail-closed before Daily Brief assemble, revision/current persistence, delivery-envelope creation, or provider work. Production scheduled runs remain single-market.
- Rollout safety: release, remote upgrade, production pointer migration, real-send canary, and scheduler observation require separate operator authorization. Rollback stops the scheduler and rolls back code/version plus compatible state; it never restores Compact as a parallel scheduled sender.

Read surfaces:

```bash
./om daily-brief latest [--account lx] [--market US|HK] [--json]
./om daily-brief day --account lx [--market US|HK] --date YYYY-MM-DD [--revision N] [--json]
./om-agent run --tool daily_decision_brief_read --input-json '{}'
./om-agent run --tool daily_decision_brief_read --input-json '{"account":"lx","market":"US"}'
```

Delivery state inspection and migration remain explicit operator commands:

```bash
./om daily-brief delivery-inspect --account lx --market HK
./om daily-brief delivery-migrate --account lx --market HK          # dry-run
./om daily-brief delivery-migrate --account lx --market HK --confirm
```
